The following table contains the stats for a typical enemy of each level:

Level	HP		Atk/Def	GP			Flat Damage
1		10-12	3-4		50-75		d8
2		14-16	5-6		125-200		2d8
3		18-20	7-8		300-450		3d8
4		22-25	9-10	650-1000	4d8

Most enemies are atypical in some respect, but a new monster should have the typical stats unless there's some reason to deviate.

[[REASONS TO DEVIATE]]
Enemies that only attack and have no special abilities have higher Atk and Def.  Examples:  Aged Swordsman, Ogre, Minotaur, Starving Lion.
Spell casting humanoid enemies are weaker physically and have lower Atk, Def, and HP.
Physically large or dense enemies have higher HP.  Examples:  Ogre, Gold Golem, Giant, Dinosaur, Titan, and many of the plants.
An enemy that is actually a group of enemies may have higher HP.  Examples:  Hobgoblin Patrol, Skeletons, Zombies, Lizard Women, Horde of Kobolds, Vampire Owls.
There are some very quick but puny enemies in the dungeon.  They have very small HP (sometimes 1), especially high defence, and high Speed (6-8). Don't add too many of these.

[[MIND]]
Things and plants have mind 0 unless they need it for some reason.  Examples: Magic Mushrooms, Possessed Tome.
Most undead have mind 0.  Some of the more powerful undead may have normal Mind values.  Example: Vampyre, Lich
Animals always have Mind 1.  Lack of intelligence is their distinguishing feature.
Dumb sentient creatures have Mind 2.  Example:  Hobgoblin Patrol, Ogre, Troll, Minotaur, Level 500 Goblin
Intelligent Enemies have Mind 3.  Example:  Evil Dwarf, Twisted Halfling, Frost Dragon, Titan
Enemies that use magic or psionics, or are well-educated, fantasically cunning or clever have 4-8 Mind.

[[SPEED]]
Most plants have Speed 0.  Some immobile things also have Speed 0.
Be careful about giving monsters a Speed of 1, since this makes them too vulnerable to paralysis (losing Speed).
Monsters slower than a man have Speed 2 or 3.
Most humanoid enemies have Speed 4.
Monsters faster than men have 5-8 speed.

[[ANIMAL]]
Animals always have Mind 1.
Their Speed, Atk, and Def vary widely by the type of animal.

[[DEMON]]

[[DRAGON]]
Dragons are among the most fearsome foes in the dungeon.  The average dragon has Atk and Def 1 point higher than typical, and a few more HP.  Most dragons have a breath weapon or other nasty spell-like ability, but can't cast spells themselves.  Dragons are more intelligent than animals due to their evil cunning and so have Mind 2-3.  Weaker dragons have Speed 5;  the older ones that haunt the deeper dungeon levels have Speed 6.  (Should more of the weaker dragons fly?)

[[Humanoid]]
Humanoid enemies form the largest group in the dungeon.  They are most likely to have typical stats.

[[PLANT]]
Most plants don't move or think:  Speed 0, Mind 0
Many Large or sprawling plants have HP much higher than the typical enemy.
Plants have trouble defending themselves and usually have a Def 1-3 points lower than the typical enemy.
Plants often use acid as an attack.
(Should more plants be strong against acid and weak to fire?)

[[QYZOX]]
Atk=2*DLV, Def 3*DLV, Mind=3, Speed=4, HP and Gold top of range.
There is one Qyzox on each level, getting older with each level. Each one has 1-7] summon dlv monster, 8] teleport.

[[THING]]
Most things are ordinary objects are collections of objects brought to life by deranged wizards. Things have Mind 0, unless they need it to cast spells.

[[UNDEAD]]
Undead generally have Mind 0, unless they are especially powerful. They are immune to draining, poison, and status ailments. Many Undead have draining attacks.

[[ELEMENTS]]
Enemies with an elemental attack are often immune to that element.
Enemies that have a fire attack are often weak to ice, and vice versa.

[[THE CARDS]]
(Note: This section refers to the Monsters.docx file that was never used)
Each monster card is 6.35x8.85 inches, the same size as a Magic the Gathering card.  The rows have heights 1.2", 1.8", 5.2", and 0.65".

[[TREASURE]]

Type		Gold	Weaker		Stronger

Animal	 	66%	Potion/Scroll	Item
Demon:		100%	Item		Chest
Dragon:		150%	Item		Item
Humanoid:	120%	Item		Chest
